# Shopify_Resource
Aim of this repo is to share the code snippets to public that could be usefull for other developers.

I have been working on Shopify for 3 years and I written code that was unique and one of its kind. Those took me weeks to write. There is not only code but also important resources to learn and my insight of how to do things as developer.

I will keep posting new code snippets and tricks.
